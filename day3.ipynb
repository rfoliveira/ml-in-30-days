    "<u>Structured data</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data refers to information that is organized in a fixed format, typically in tables, spreadsheets, or relational databases. It follows a predefined schema with rows and columns, making it easy to store, query, and analyze using database management systems and analytical tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of structured data: \n",
    "- Customer transaction records in a retail store  \n",
    "- Employee databases containing names, salaries, and job titles  \n",
    "- Financial statements showing revenues and expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data is advantageous for machine learning as it can be easily manipulated using programming languages like Python, SQL, and libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Unstructured data</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured data, on the other hand, lacks a predefined format and does not fit neatly into tables or relational databases. It includes text, images, audio, and video files. Processing unstructured data requires specialized techniques, including natural language processing (NLP) for text, computer vision for images, and speech recognition for audio. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of unstructured data: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Social media posts, emails, and chat messages  \n",
    "- Medical imaging scans such as X-rays and MRIs  \n",
    "- Audio recordings and speech transcriptions  \n",
    "- Handling unstructured data often involves feature extraction and transformation techniques to convert the raw data into a structured format suitable for machine learning models."
